# Bonhomme-Dano-Graham-SERIES
This repository contains the replication code for "Identification in a Binary Choice Panel Data Model with a Predetermined Covariate" by Stephane Bonhomme, Kevin Dano and Bryan Graham.

## Replication instructions
To run the code and replicate our results you must have installed [Julia version 1.5.3](https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/).

The julia folder contains 8 files:
 - `Identified_Set_Logit_T2.jl`,`Identified_Set_Logit_T3.jl`,`Identified_Set_Logit_T4.jl`,`Identified_Set_Probit_T2.jl`,`Identified_Set_Probit_T3.jl`,`Identified_Set_Probit_T4.jl` replicate Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the main text.
 - `Identified_Set_Logit_T2_Approx.jl`,`Identified_Set_Probit_T2_Approx.jl` replicate Appendix Figure 1 and Appendix Figure 2.

Each julia script must be run individually to produce the relevant figures.
